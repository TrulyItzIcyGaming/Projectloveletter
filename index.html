    <p>this was not made by who gave you the note, it was made by me, I am the crush
      <br><br>Hello, I have been spending a week or more trying to come up with so many things to confess because I don't wanna be lazy, I want you to truly
    see I care and will do anything for you, this is what I got done, I did plan to make music but thats hard to learn to do and I never finished it, but I seriously want you to give this a chance
    you can say any response yes, no, whatever, but I ask you look through this keeping in mind how much effort this actally took me to make for you.
