    <p>Hello, I know you don't know me that well, but please just give me the chance to show you who I am, I have noticed you recently during breakfast and lunch and I just honestly be into you, I know that it may be a long process, but I am willing to take it slow and get to know each other for however long you need or want, all I want is a chance you know, I promise you I seriously will do everything for you, I am not one of those people who want to use, I seriously value you and want to make your life better, I want you to succeed, I want you to have someone you can go to if you ever just need comfort and advice, and I understand that may not be me in your eyes, and that's fine, you have full right to say no, but I do request you allow me to show who I am first, because I want to be great for you.

      Thank you for reading this, I have been scared to actally confess but I also wanted to do something meaningful, not just tell you you know.</p>
