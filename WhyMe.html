    <p>I wont really be saying much about who I am myself but more what the people around me have told me.
        <br><br>1. "You're someone I can trust, yk, someone I can always look to if I need help with something or jus someone to talk to, you're comforting" - kye
        <br><br>2. "So uhh.. Brandon, I think of you as a very smart individual. You have the brains of a computer, its so complex. And that's not a bad thing. I find that honestly quite cool, knowing I'm quite advanced with tech myself! I think you are very kind, you try to interact and do the most you can with People. Even when things are sour, your soul is very bright. You are a rare. You are a shiny Pokemon. You are the bright nose on Rudolph that makes everyone happy." - Maus 
        <br><br>3. "Your a very nice person from what i know you try to help people a lot" - river
        <br><br>4. "you are a weird but amazing nerdy person, you are super nice and I think of you as a good friend, like-  super weird and nerdy but i like it, i think its funny and it makes you unique, you my weird nerdy sophomore friend are amazing and very..something else, but a good something else" - griffin
