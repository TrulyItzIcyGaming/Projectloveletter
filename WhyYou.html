    <p>There are many reasons why you specifically out of everyone stood out, but heres the biggest things that caught my eye.
      <br><br>1. Your energy seems to just be a vibe and make any enviroment just more interesting, I have noticed this and I do the same thing sometimes.
      <br><br>2. Another thing is, your blue bit of hair, like that just interests me a lot.
      <br><br>3. Your headphones gave me a music liking vibe which I really am into music myself recently and omg if you make music I will fall deep.
      <br><br>4. I personally see a smart vibe from you, but I can't fact check that.
      <br><br>5. When I have seen you smile in the halls, it just shines and honestly puts me in a good mood.
      <br><br>Generally I just really like who you are as a person, and really want to try to get to verify and learn more about this wonderful person in front of me.
      <br><br>This section is less why I like you but what this has caused me.
      <br><br>1. I have became extremely motivated in life just thinking about the possiblity of you saying yes.
      <br><br>2. I have been a lot less sad, because I feel like now I may be able to have someone, I want to be the best for you and make you happy
      <br><br>3. I made literally 3 playlists about love for you xd..... yea, I am a bit of a emotional simp here
