    <p>I really dont want or expect any much from you, I just want a chance to get to know each other, and to eventally if we have a bond maybe get into something, and even then all I want is someone I can jump on call with at night, feel comfort with. I want to make sure you are happy and sucessful. I want to see you smile daily. I just want to have someone I feel safe to tell everything to but also someone who feels safe to tell me everything too. I want someone I can give my everything to and get given their everything back. I want someone who wants to talk to me every night even if its just for the calm and happy presence we will have. 
        <br><br>If you say yes, I will give you everything I have, because anyone can tell you, I want to see you happy, I want to see YOU thrive. if yours thriving and doing well, I belive I will too, I wont stop coding websites for you, I wont stop learning for you, and I especially will never stop caring and comforting you, but I need a yes first.
        <br><br>But if its a no, thats alright, I just want you to focus on finding someone who cares about you and doesn't want to use you like a toy but wants to give you everything, comfort, happyiness, anything you desire.
